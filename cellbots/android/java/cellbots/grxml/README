This folder includes all the data necessary to compile the cellbot grammar (cellbot.grxml) file
into a format that can be used with the SREC speech recognition engine.

Before compiling the grammar, you will need to generate a grxmlcompile executable by obtaining and
building the Android source tree. Yes, this is painful, but you only need to do it once. When you're
done, check <android-src>/out/host/<host-arch>/bin/ and make sure there's a grxmlcompile executable.
You may want to add the bin folder to your path with "export PATH=$PATH:<path-to-bin>".

Next, run "./compile.sh cellbot" to generate the binary G2G file needed for SREC. The script will
automatically drop the resulting cellbot.g2g file into the res/raw folder. If you're using Eclipse,
make sure to refresh your project so that you're using the new raw resource.

If you're interested in making changes to the GRXML source, take a look at the W3C grammar spec at
http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/ and some example grammars from the Android source tree at
<android-src>/external/srec/config/en.us/grammars/
