To use the Makefile set the variable NXC_PATH to the path to your
copy of nxc and nxtcom. This can be done on Mac and Linux by typing
export NXC_PATH=<path to nxc folder>.

Then, "make all" will build and push the lego program over.

Currently, the program is named RobotCommand. You can change the
name of the output file by modifying the OUTPUT variable in the
Makefile.
